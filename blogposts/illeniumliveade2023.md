Going to an Illenium concert at the Amsterdam Dance Event was a dream come true. I've been a fan for 10 years and seeing him live for the first time was amazing.

The concert was at Melkweg, a famous place in Amsterdam. Illenium played alot of his songs which I recognized all. He was on stage with a band which included some other big artists like Annika Wells and Said The Sky. These I am also a great fan off.

His music is a mix of melodic softer sounds and more heavy bass. It also includes alot of vocals. Genre which describes it best would be melodic bass, dubstep, future bass. Blending big wall of sounds with bass stabs and strong heavy leads. The pase of the music is slower, with the kick drum and snare carrying the ryhtm. Each song had different visuals, and they were all pretty amazing.

After the concert, I met with some people from Reddit. We had a good time talking about Illenium's music and drank some beers and talked about the amazing show.

The ADE concert was a great experience and I can't wait for the next one. Now, I'm even more excited to see Illenium again in LA in February!
